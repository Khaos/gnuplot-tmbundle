# The Gnuplot TextMate bundle

## Introduction

Aims to provide a useful set of commands, snippets and language support for
writing and running gnuplot scripts within [TextMate](http://macromates.com/).

So far, various features have been implemented, including:

  * Rudimentary syntax hilighting.
  * Script execution -- pressing ' ⌘R' pipes the script through gnuplot.
  * Online help -- pressing '⌃H' with the caret over a keyword pops up an HTML window containing gnuplot's built-in help for that keyword.
  
There are a cople of issus with the help, see the end of the `fillstyle` entry, for example, but these are minor, and seem to be due to bugs in bluecloth.

Future work will be focused on providing completion, and improving the help
command -- especially formatting of the output.
