# Introduction

The Gnuplot bundle is a set of snippets and completion commands designed to help you use [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/), an incredibly powerful plotting utility.

This bundle attempts to adapt to the many different commands available on different gnuplot builds by using your system's gnuplot binary for completion whereever possible.

# Notes

For best results, you'll need TextMate to be able to see a `gnuplot` binary. 

To find out if it can, type: `which gnuplot` into an empty file, and press ‚åÉR. You should see something like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;which gnuplot
/usr/local/bin/gnuplot&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't, then make sure you have gnuplot installed. Typical instalation commands are:
 * fink install gnuplot-nox
 * port install gnuplot
 * installing the Octave Mac OS X build will give you a bundled version of Gnuplot.app. You can use the binary directly by looking in `Gnuplot.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gnuplot`

For information on modifying Textmate's search path, see [this part of the manual](http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/shell_commands#search_path).
